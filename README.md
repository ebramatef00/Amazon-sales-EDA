# Amazon Sales EDA

## Overview
The **Amazon Sales EDA** project involves analyzing sales data from Amazon to gain insights into product performance, customer behavior, and trends. By exploring the data, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and actionable information.

## Data
The dataset (`amazon_sales.csv`) contains information such as product categories, sales volumes, customer ratings, and more.

## Exploratory Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for key variables.
3. **Visualizations**: Create plots (bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) to visualize sales trends, customer ratings, and other relevant metrics.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by adding more analyses, improving visualizations, or exploring additional dimensions of the data.
